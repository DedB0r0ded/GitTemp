## Temporary project for Git learning
This project was created to test some Git functions like: 
- [x] merge 
- [x] rebase 
- [ ] cherry-pick 
- [ ] **push** 
- [ ] **pull**

Changes in `index.html` are tracked by `feature_html` branch.       
Changes in `script.js` are tracked by `feature_js` branch.    
Changes in `style.css` are tracked by `feature_css` branch.  
Changes in `README.md` are tracked by `feature_readme` branch.  

*Branching is based on **GitFLow**.*
*Merging is prefered to rebasing*
